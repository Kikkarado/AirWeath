Controlling the level of SO2 and implementing effective gas cleaning technologies are important to reduce its emissions and ensure clean air and a healthy environment.</string>
    <string name="about_o3">O3 (ozone) is a gas that is formed in the atmosphere by solar radiation and chemical reactions with other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. In the lower atmosphere (troposphere), O3 is a harmful pollutant. When binding to the respiratory tract, O3 can cause irritation and inflammation, contributing to the development of asthma and other respiratory diseases. High levels of O3 can also negatively affect plant life, reducing their photosynthetic activity and productivity. O3 is a key component of smog, especially in warm and sunny climates. To reduce the formation of O3, it is necessary to control the emissions of its precursors, such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, as well as to promote the efficient operation and development of alternative energy sources and transport with a low content of pollutants.</string>
    <string name="about_dust">Dust in the atmosphere consists of solid particles that can be of organic or inorganic origin. This type of air pollution includes dust, dust storms, volcanic ash, and other mineral particles that can rise into the air and travel great distances. Dust can have a harmful effect on the health of people, especially those with respiratory problems. Inhaling dust can irritate the respiratory tract and contribute to the development of asthma, allergies and other diseases. In addition, dust can pollute air, water and soil, affecting the ecological balance and health of ecosystems. Controlling the level of dust and developing strategies to minimize its emissions are important for preserving air quality and the health of people and the environment.</string>
    <string name="about_nh3">NH3 (ammonia) is a gaseous substance that is formed as a result of the decomposition of organic matter, as well as emissions from agricultural activities, industry and the use of fertilizers. High levels of NH3 in the atmosphere can have a negative impact on human health and the environment. Inhaling ammonia can irritate the airways and cause breathing problems, especially in people with respiratory conditions. In addition, ammonia can cause acid rain and affect aquatic ecosystems. Apart from agricultural applications, controlling the levels of NH3 in the atmosphere and using effective technologies to minimize its emissions are important steps to ensure clean air and maintain ecological balance.</string>
